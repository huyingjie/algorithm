## Problem
Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Python

```python
#!python3
```
